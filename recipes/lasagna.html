        <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>

        <li>2 cans (6 oz) tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp white sugar</li>
        <li>4 tbsp chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp salt, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 oz ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3/4 lb mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. 
            Season with sugar, 2 tbsp parsley, basil, 1 tsp salt, Italian seasoning, fennel
        seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tbsp parsley,
            and 1/2 tsp salt.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch
             baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping 
             slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture.
              Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. 
              Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella,
               and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. 
            Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking 
            spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake 
            for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
